  <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
  <p class="about-lead">
    Hi! I’m a Computer Science major at UT San Antonio, graduating in <b>Spring 2026</b>. My journey in information security began back in high school through the Air Force Association’s CyberPatriot competition, which first sparked my passion for the field. 
    That competitive drive followed me into college, where I’ve taken part in national competitions such as CCDC, CPTC, and DOE CyberForce, gaining hands-on experience in both attack and defense scenarios. Along the way, I’ve also contributed to academic research in cybersecurity, building on what I’ve learned in these environments.
    This blog is my space to share that journey, from competitions and research to the projects and lessons that continue to shape me as a security professional.
  <br>
  </br> I am currently seeking my next opportunity in cybersecurity. If you believe my background aligns with your team’s needs, please feel free to connect or chat with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexis-o/">LinkedIn</a>!
